personal-site
=============

My personal art portfolio site. 

Written with Sass.
I chose to include each image as a separate page in order to facilitate backlinks,
and for archiving purposes––I will be able to change my site and even remove internal links to images without breaking backlinks. 

All content of the site is copywrited.
